multiplied is a powerful tool to build, test, and analyse multiplier designs.


The Problem
-----------
Generating and analysing multiplier designs by hand is labour intensive, even for small datasets, for entire `truth tables <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table>`__, this is close to impossible.

multiplied is built to streamline this process:

- Custom partial product reduction via `templates <https://github.com/EphraimCompEng/multiplied/blob/master/docs/structures/templates.md>`__
- Generating complete truth tables
- Analysis, plotting, and managing datasets
- Fine-grain access to bits, words or stages
