# MultiPy

A powerful tool to build, test, and analyse multiplier designs.


# Why?

Generating and analysing multiplier designs by hand is labour intensive, even for small datasets, for entire [truth tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table), this is close to impossible.

MultiPy provides tools for:

- Custom partial product reduction via [templates](https://github.com/EphraimCompEng/multipy/blob/master/docs/structures/templates.md)
- Generating truth tables for algorithms
- Analysis, plotting, and managing datasets
- Fine-grain access to bits, words or stages 


# Documentation

Documentation continues to grow with the project. Resouces for usage, general theory and implementations using MultiPy can be found in this repository. 

For more information head to [/docs/](https://github.com/EphraimCompEng/multiplier-lab/tree/master/docs). 


# Setup
