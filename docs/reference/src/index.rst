MultiPy Documentation
=====================

A powerful tool to build, test, and analyse multiplier designs.



Generating and analysing multiplier designs by hand is labour intensive, even for small datasets, for entire truth tables, this is close to impossible.

MultiPy provides tools for:

- Custom partial product reduction via templates
- Generating complete truth tables
- Analysis, plotting, and managing datasets
- Fine-grain access to bits, words or stages
