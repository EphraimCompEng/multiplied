### 8b_mult_partial.py
This file is the original "v0.0.0" version of the 8-bit multiplier partial product generator which used JSON to store it's output. No templates, no analysis. 

v0.0.0 -> v0.1.0 will be a refactor of '8b_mult_partial.py' to add typehints and functionality to act as a library. 

This the minimum point at which the project can go public.
