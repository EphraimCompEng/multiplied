# MultiPy

A powerful tool for building, testing, and analysing multiplier designs. 


# Why?

Generating and analysing multiplier designs by hand is labour intensive, even for small datasets. For entire [truth tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table), this becomes close to impossible after 8-bits.

MultiPy aims to be a general tool for:

- Building partial product reduction layers
- Generate complete truth tables of custom multipliers
- Analyse and plot trends across entire datasets 
- Track bits, columns, rows of reduction stages

???{

Use [typst](https://typst.app/)?

Use [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)?

}

# Setup


???{

-> Configure [TOML](https://toml.io/) file? and or use CLI to configure the TOML? -> main.py uses TOML to set variables

-> Choose default dataset or build own [Parquet](https://github.com/apache/parquet-format)?

-> import templates to /src/templates/
}

# Roadmap

- [ ] Manage dependencies and automatically resolve them -- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)?
- [ ] Find optimal data structure for combinational multiply stages 
- [ ] Standardise templates 
- [ ] Find optimal file format: parquet?
- [ ] Custom reduction stage templates

- [ ] 8-bit unsaturated multiply
- [ ] 8-bit saturated multiply

Only after: optimal data structure, file formats and standardisation of loading and storing data, is a achieved can 16-bit can be attempted. The potential dataset of 16-bit+ multipliers becomes astronomical and the program must be rebust enough to deal with this efficiently.
- [ ] 16-bit unsaturated multiply
- [ ] 16-bit saturated multiply
- [ ] 32-bit saturated multiply
